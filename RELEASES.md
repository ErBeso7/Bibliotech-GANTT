# v1.0.0 — Initial release

Release date: 2025-12-16

Initial public release of the Gantt chart for the Bibliotech project. Includes the first implementation with basic features:

- Interactive timeline with zoom and pan
- Task creation and editing (title, start/end, assignee)
- Dependency display between tasks
- Export chart to PNG

Assets: None included in this release.

Notes: This is the first stable public release. If you want me to also publish the GitHub release entry (tag + notes) I can provide the exact `gh` or `curl` command you can run, or set up a GitHub Action to publish releases automatically.
